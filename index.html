<p>This repository documents the setup proceedures the for the following downloadable Vagrant boxes:</p>

<h4 id="ubuntu-server-1304-raring-ringtail">Ubuntu Server 13.04 “Raring Ringtail”</h4>

<p>This box is configured according to the suggested base box configuration and includes Chef and Puppet. If you're curious as to how it was configured, check out the <a href="http://josiah.github.io/VagrantBoxes/ubuntu-server-raring64.html" title="Ubuntu Server 13.04 “Raring Ringtail” setup instructions">setup instructions</a> or take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Josiah/VagrantBoxes/blob/master/ubuntu-server-raring64.sh" title="Ubuntu Server 13.04 “Raring Ringtail” shell script">shell script</a> used to create it.</p>

<p>Use the configuration below in your <code>Vagrantfile</code> or <a href="https://copy.com/ihzTonCKxAiH" title="Ubuntu Server 13.04 “Raring Ringtail” base box download">download the base box</a>
directly.</p>

<pre><code>config.vm.box = "ubuntu-server-raring64"
config.vm.box_url = "https://copy.com/ihzTonCKxAiH/ubuntu-server-raring64.box"
</code></pre>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>There are services which provide created boxes (such as <a href="http://vagrantbox.es">vagrantbox.es</a>)
and there are tools to generate them from scripts (such as <a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">veewee</a>). The
former aren't doesn't have any boxes which match my needs and I couldn't make
the latter install thanks to ruby dependency hell.</p>

<p>After trying with both to generate a working base box for Ubuntu Server 13.04
I gave up and did it manually. Rather than forgetting how I did it and having
to learn it again when I have to do it again I decided to document the
process. Taking it a step further, I documented the process as a shell script
so that I had less work to do next time.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
